# Agentic Reliability Framework (ARF) v3.3.9 — Production Stability Release

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT OSS DISCLAIMER**
>
> It **does NOT execute actions**, **does NOT auto-heal**, and **does NOT perform remediation**.
>
> All execution, automation, persistence, and learning loops are **Enterprise-only** features.

## Executive Summary

Modern systems do not fail because metrics are missing.

They fail because **decisions arrive too late**.

ARF is a **graph-native, agentic reliability platform** that treats incidents as *memory and reasoning problems*, not alerting problems. It captures operational experience, reasons over it using AI agents, and enforces **stable, production-grade execution boundaries** for autonomous healing.

This is not another monitoring tool.

This is **operational intelligence**.

A dual-architecture reliability framework where **OSS analyzes and creates intent**, and **Enterprise safely executes intent**.

This repository contains the **Apache 2.0 OSS edition (v3.3.9)**. Enterprise components are distributed separately under a commercial license.

> **v3.3.9 Production Stability Release**
>
> This release finalizes import compatibility, eliminates circular dependencies,
> and enforces clean OSS/Enterprise boundaries.  
> **All public imports are now guaranteed stable for production use.**

---

## Why ARF Exists

**The Problem**

- **AI Agents Fail in Production**: 73% of AI agent projects fail due to unpredictability, lack of memory, and unsafe execution
- **MTTR is Too High**: Average incident resolution takes 14+ minutes _in traditional systems_.
  \*_Measured MTTR reductions are Enterprise-only and require execution + learning loops._
- **Alert Fatigue**: Teams ignore 40%+ of alerts due to false positives and lack of context
- **No Learning**: Systems repeat the same failures because they don't remember past incidents

Traditional reliability stacks optimize for:
- Detection latency
- Alert volume
- Dashboard density

But the real business loss happens between:

> *“Something is wrong” → “We know what to do.”*

ARF collapses that gap by providing a hybrid intelligence system that advises safely in OSS and executes deterministically in Enterprise. 

---

🎯 What This Actually Does
--------------------------

**OSS Edition (Apache 2.0)**

The open-source edition of the Agentic Reliability Framework is designed for **advisory intelligence**, **incident understanding**, and **safe decision support** not autonomous execution.

### Core Capabilities

*   **Reliability Event Intake** Accepts structured reliability and operational events with configurable thresholds and metadata for downstream analysis.
    
*   **Multi-Stage Analysis Pipeline** Performs detection, diagnosis, and predictive reasoning to assess incident context, potential causes, and downstream risk.
    
*   **Historical Pattern Recall** Identifies similar past incidents using vector-based similarity techniques to surface precedent and comparative outcomes.
    
*   **Advisory Planning Output** Produces structured, immutable remediation plans that describe _what could be done_, _why_, and _with what expected impact_—without taking action.
    
*   **Deterministic Safety Guardrails** Applies explicit, configuration-driven policies to constrain recommendations (e.g., scope limits, restricted actions, compliance boundaries).
    
*   **Business Impact Estimation** Estimates user, revenue, or operational impact based on event metadata and configurable models.
    
*   **In-Memory Operation Only** Operates entirely in memory with bounded retention suitable for development, research, and evaluation use cases.
    
### 💡 How ARF OSS Adds Value Today

**OSS Advisory Flow (Advisory-Only)**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Detection 🟢 OSS] --> B[Recall 🟢 OSS]
    B --> C[Decision 🟢 OSS]
    C --> D[HealingIntent 🟢 OSS]
    D --> E[Execution 🔵 Enterprise Only]

    %% Optional: Dashed line for Enterprise-only node
    E -.->|Enterprise-only| D

```

**Key:** 
**🟢 Green = OSS Advisory Capabilities**
**🔵 Blue = Enterprise Execution (not included in OSS)**

*   **Detection** – Identify anomalies and operational events in real time
    
*   **Recall** – Retrieve historical incidents and context for informed reasoning
    
*   **Decision** – Apply deterministic, explainable rules for advisory guidance
    
*   **HealingIntent** – Generate structured, safe remediation recommendations
    
*   **Execution** – Enterprise-only; OSS stops before this step

| Feature                                  | OSS 🟢 | Enterprise 🔵 |
| ---------------------------------------- | :----: | :-----------: |
| Detection & Anomaly Monitoring           |    ✅   |       ✅       |
| Historical Recall & RAG Context          |    ✅   |       ✅       |
| Deterministic Decision Policies          |    ✅   |       ✅       |
| Advisory Remediation Plans               |    ✅   |       ✅       |
| Autonomous Execution                     |    ❌   |       ✅       |
| Learning & Self-Optimization Loops       |    ❌   |       ✅       |
| Persistent Storage & Memory              |    ❌   |       ✅       |
| Compliance & Audit Workflows             |    ❌   |       ✅       |
| Multi-Tenant Control / Scoped Operations |    ❌   |       ✅       |
| Business Impact Measurement & Analytics  |    ❌   |       ✅       |

> Quick visual reference for OSS vs Enterprise capabilities. OSS delivers full intelligence, stopping safely at advisory intent, while Enterprise extends that intelligence to execution and outcome optimization.

### Explicit OSS Constraints (By Design)

*   **Advisory-Only**The OSS edition never executes changes, deploys fixes, or mutates production systems.
    
*   **No Autonomous Learning**Historical data is used for recall and comparison only; the system does not self-train or update models over time.
    
*   **No Persistent Storage**Incident context and memory are ephemeral and capped to prevent long-term retention.
    
*   **Single-Context Operation**No multi-tenant isolation, enterprise policy layering, or cross-environment orchestration.
    
### Intended Use Cases

*   Reliability experimentation and research
    
*   Incident postmortems and what-if analysis
    
*   Agentic system prototyping
    
*   Safety-constrained AI planning demonstrations
    
*   Evaluation of agent reasoning quality without execution risk   

### Architectural Guarantees

*   **Advisory-Only by Design** — no hidden execution paths
    
*   **Deterministic & Explainable** — no silent learning loops
    
*   **Thread-Safe & Production-Ready**
    
*   **Configuration-Driven Behavior** via OSSConfig
    
*   **Type-Safe APIs** using Pydantic v2 and Python 3.10+
    
*   **Extensible Agent Architecture** with explicit interfaces

> Execution, persistence, and autonomous actions are exclusive to Enterprise.

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 🟢 ARF (OSS)           | Context-aware analysis            | High (advisory-only)      | High        | ❌         |
| 🔵 ARF (Enterprise)    | Advanced reliability intelligence | High (governed execution) | High        | ✅         |
| Traditional Monitoring | Alert-based                       | High                      | High        | ❌         |
| LLM-Only Agents        | Heuristic                         | Low                       | Low         | ⚠️        |


**Governed execution modes (Enterprise-only)**Enterprise deployments support multiple permissioned execution configurations with varying levels of human oversight. Specific modes, controls, and workflows are not part of the OSS distribution.

**Migration Paths**

| Current Solution       | Migration Strategy                       | Expected Benefit                                          | Applies To |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Traditional Monitoring | Layer ARF on top for predictive insights | Shift from reactive to proactive with 6x faster detection | 🔵         |
| Manual Operations      | Start with ARF in Advisory mode          | Reduce toil while maintaining control during transition   | 🟢         |

**Decision Framework** 

**Choose ARF if you need:** 

*   ✅ Autonomous operation with safety guarantees 
    
*   ✅ Continuous improvement through learning 
    
*   ✅ Quantifiable business impact measurement  
    
*   ✅ Hybrid intelligence (AI + rules) 
    
*   ✅ Production-grade reliability (circuit breakers, thread safety, graceful degradation) 
    

**Consider alternatives if you:** 

*   ❌ Only need basic alerting (use traditional monitoring) 
    
*   ❌ Require simple, static automation (use scripts) 
    
*   ❌ Are experimenting with AI agents (use LLM frameworks) 
    
*   ❌ Have regulatory requirements prohibiting any autonomous action 
    
_ARF provides the intelligence of AI agents with the reliability of traditional automation, creating a new category of "Reliable AI Systems."_

🔧 Architecture
-------------------------------

## Conceptual Architecture (Mental Model)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Detection 🟢 OSS] --> B[Recall 🟢 OSS]
    B --> C[Decision 🟢 OSS]
    C --> D[HealingIntent 🟢 OSS]
    D --> E[Execution 🔵 Enterprise Only]

```

**Key insight:** Reliability improves when systems *remember*.

**Architecture Philosophy**: Each layer addresses a critical failure mode of current AI systems: 

1.  **Cognitive Layer** prevents _"reasoning from scratch"_ for each incident 
    
2.  **Memory Layer** prevents _"forgetting past learnings"_ 
    
3.  **Execution Layer** prevents _"unsafe, unconstrained actions"_


### Healing Intent Boundary

OSS **creates** intent.  
Enterprise **executes** intent. The framework **separates intent creation from execution**

``` 
+----------------+         +---------------------+
|   OSS Layer    |         |  Enterprise Layer   |
| (Analysis Only)|         |  (Execution & GNN)  |
+----------------+         +---------------------+
          |                           ^
          |       HealingIntent       |
          +-------------------------->|
```

**Key Orchestration Steps:** 

1.  **Event Ingestion & Validation** - Accepts telemetry, validates with Pydantic models 
    
2.  **Multi-Agent Analysis** - Parallel execution of specialized agents 
    
3.  **RAG Context Retrieval** - Semantic search for similar historical incidents 
    
4.  **Policy Evaluation** - Deterministic rule-based action determination 
    
5.  **Action Enhancement** - Historical effectiveness data informs priority
   
6.  Later execution, outcome evaluation, and learning stages exist exclusively in Enterprise deployments and are intentionally omitted from OSS documentation.

## OSS vs Enterprise Philosophy

### OSS (Apache 2.0)
- Full intelligence
- Advisory-only execution
- Hard safety limits
- Perfect for trust-building

### Enterprise
- Autonomous healing
- Learning loops
- Compliance (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- Audit trails
- Multi-tenant control

OSS proves value.  
Enterprise captures it.

---

### 💰 Business Value and ROI

Quantitative performance metrics, benchmarks, and ROI analyses are derived exclusively from Enterprise deployments and are not disclosed in the OSS distribution.

## 🔒 Stability Guarantees (v3.3.9+)

ARF v3.3.9 introduces **hard stability guarantees** for OSS users:

- ✅ No circular imports
- ✅ Direct, absolute imports for all public APIs
- ✅ Pydantic v2 ↔ Dataclass compatibility wrapper
- ✅ Graceful fallback behavior (no runtime crashes)
- ✅ Advisory-only execution enforced at runtime

If you can import it, it is safe to use in production.

Quantitative productivity, ROI, and MTTR improvements are measured in Enterprise deployments and shared privately during evaluations.

### 🔒 Security & Compliance


**Layer Breakdown:**

*   **Action Blacklisting** – Prevent dangerous operations
    
*   **Blast Radius Limiting** – Limit impact scope (max: 3 services)
    
*   **Human Approval Workflows** – Manual review for sensitive changes
    
*   **Business Hour Restrictions** – Control deployment windows
    
*   **Circuit Breakers & Cooldowns** – Automatic rate limiting
    

#### Compliance Features

*   **Audit Trail:** Every MCP request/response logged with justification
    
*   **Approval Workflows:** Human review for sensitive actions
    
*   **Data Retention:** Configurable retention policies (default: 30 days)
    
*   **Access Control:** Tool-level permission requirements
    
*   **Change Management:** Business hour restrictions for production changes
    

#### Security Best Practices

1.  **Start in Advisory Mode**
    
    *   Begin with analysis-only mode to understand potential actions without execution risks.
        
2.  **Gradual Rollout**
    
    *   Use rollout\_percentage parameter to enable features incrementally across your systems.
        
3.  **Regular Audits**
    
    *   Review learned patterns and outcomes monthly
        
    *   Adjust safety parameters based on historical data
        
    *   Validate compliance with organizational policies
        
4.  **Environment Segregation**
    
    *   Configure different MCP modes per environment:
        
        *   **Development:** autonomous or advisory
            
        *   **Staging:** approval
            
        *   **Production:** advisory or approval
          
**Enterprise Safety Model (High-Level)**Enterprise deployments apply multiple layers of safety controls, including permission boundaries, scope constraints, approval workflows, and rate-limiting mechanisms. These controls are configurable per organization and environment and are intentionally not exposed in the OSS edition.

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Initial Setup:** Configure action blacklists and blast radius limits  
2. **Testing Phase:** Run in advisory mode to analyze behavior  
3. **Gradual Enablement:** Move to approval mode with human oversight  
4. **Production:** Maintain approval workflows for critical systems  
5. **Optimization:** Adjust parameters based on audit findings
